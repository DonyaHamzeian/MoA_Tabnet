# MoA_Tabnet
We tried to use TabNet for the Mechanism of Action (MoA) prediction which was a Kaggle competitio: https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa
This project was a multilabel classification with highly imbalanced dataset. 
We used TabNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442) for prediction. TabNet uses sequential attention to select features for reasoning at each decision step. We tuned some of the most important hyperparameters of TabNet. Additionally, we used pseudo labels and data augmentation.
